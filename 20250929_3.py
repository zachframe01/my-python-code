""""Write a program whose input is a string 
which contains a character and a phrase, and
 whose output indicates the number of times 
 the character appears in the phrase. 
 The output should include the input character 
 and use the plural form, n's, if the number of 
 times the characters appears is not exactly 1.

Ex: If the input is:

n Monday
the output is:

1 n
Ex: If the input is:

z Today is Monday
the output is:

0 z's
Ex: If the input is:

n It's a sunny day
the output is:

2 n's
Case matters. n is different than N.

Ex: If the input is:

n Nobody
the output is:

0 n's
